# Features

Omaforge comes packed with carefully curated features designed to provide a modern, productive development environment out of the box. Here are some of the key highlights that make Omaforge stand out.

## Wayland first

Omaforge is built on and optimized for Wayland, the modern display server protocol that offers improved security, performance, and graphics capabilities. While compatibility tools are available for legacy X11 applications, Omaforge is _primarily oriented_ towards the Wayland ecosystem, ensuring you get the best possible experience with modern Linux desktop technologies.

## GNOME with Forge Extension

Experience the power of tiling window management with the seamless integration of [`Forge`](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge), a tiling window manager extension for GNOME. Enjoy automatic window arrangement, keyboard-driven workflows, and improved productivity without sacrificing GNOME's polish and user-friendliness.

And to maintain consistency between windows, [`Rounded Window Corners Reload`](https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners) has also been added which applies the same rounded edge to all windows.

## Navigation

Navigation in Omaforge is designed to be _keyboard-centric_, emphasizing shortcuts and efficient workflows. This approach allows for faster, more productive interactions with your desktop environment.

## No Overview or App Grid

Omaforge eliminates the traditional GNOME Overview and application grid, streamlining the user interface and encouraging a more focused workflow. This design choice aligns with the overall goal of creating a _keyboard-driven_ experience, where users can quickly access and manage their applications without the need for visual clutter.

## Custom Menu and CLI

You can manage Omaforge and its features both through a redesigned menu and a custom-built CLI to replicate its functionality and extend it to other features.

## Wofi Integration

Omaforge features seamless integration with [`Wofi`](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi), a powerful application launcher for Wayland. This allows for quick access to applications and themes, providing an organized system while GNOME's built-in application launcher remains available.

## Minimal and Essential Software

The system ships with a carefully curated selection of essential tools for GNOME management, deliberately excluding software centers and Snap packages to maintain focus and simplicity. Flatpak comes _pre-configured_ and ready to use from the command line, putting you in _complete control_ of your software installation process.

This minimalist philosophy ensures a lightweight, customizable foundation where you can build your ideal development environment by adding _only what you truly need_, when you need it.
