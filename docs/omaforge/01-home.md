# Omaforge

## What is Omaforge?

Omaforge can be considered a personalized derivative of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), the one-liner tool that turns a fresh [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) install into a modern development environment. It takes Omakub a step further, transforming GNOME with [`Forge`](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge) into a tiling-like, streamlined workspace â€” minimal, opinionated, and developer-focused, inspired by [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).

## Why Omaforge?

Omakub was created with the aim of offering a pleasant and familiar environment, making the transition from other operating systems to the Linux world smoother. The idea is to preserve the habits and workflows people are used to, relying on GNOME, which lends itself well to this purpose, and on the work done by Canonical in ensuring excellent hardware support through Ubuntu.

Yet, in the Linux community, _Ubuntu Desktop is often seen as a rather heavy distribution_, filled with components that may or may not be useful, and _even its so-called minimal edition is not all that minimal_. Its native tiling system is far from exciting, and although [`Tactile`](https://gitlab.com/lundal/tactile) does a decent job, there is still that lingering sense of something missing without proper autotiling.

Taking inspiration from the work done on Omarchy, Omaforge moves away from a fresh release of Ubuntu Desktop and instead builds on the leaner **Ubuntu Server** edition.

From here, the goal is no longer to simply recreate macOS or Windows one-to-one, but rather to capture the essence of window managers by using GNOME extensions such as [`Forge`](https://github.com/forge-ext/forge) and [`Rounded Window Corners Rebord`](https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners) and bringing the focus back to keyboard-driven control.

Of course, there are compromises along the way, but the intention is not to present this as the final solution. _This is meant to be an attempt to move towards achieving it._
