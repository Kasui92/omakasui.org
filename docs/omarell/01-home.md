# Omarell

## What is Omarell?

Omarell was the progenitor of [Omakube](https://github.com/Kasui92/omakube), hence the idea of creating a more "modern" version of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), closer to the mentality grown with [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).

The name came from [_umarell_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umarell), the Italian archetype of a retiree watching construction sites with a critical eye. Just like these elders, Omarell followed the development of Omarchy and has brought over as much as possible to Omakub, while still keeping Ubuntu as its solid foundation.

## Why Omarell?

Omarell was born from the need to create an environment tailored to my workflow, carrying only the few applications I actually use everywhere. No unnecessary bloat, just the essentials.
