# Features

A collection of features that make Omarell lightweight, flexible, and tailored to real everyday use.

## In the heart is Omakub...

It's called Omakube, but that's only a superficial name. Deep down, _it's still the same, beloved Omakub_. The folders, variables, and scripts bear his name, and that's the way it will always be. It's not meant to be anything else...and this is also to ensure it's always compatible with the project it's based on.

## ...but with the passion of Omarchy

The drive and desire to provide something interesting and enjoyable comes from _Omarchy_, which constantly observes and borrows ideas. Whenever a valuable feature appears, if it can be implemented without compromising stability, chances are it will be found here as well.

## Wofi App Launcher & Unified Menu

Omarell features seamless integration with [`Wofi`](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi), a powerful application launcher for Wayland. This allows for quick access to applications, themes and, most importantly, a **Unified Menu** for all Omarell/Omakub features.

## More Themes

There are a few more default themes than Omakub (_catppuccin-latte_ and _osaka-jade_), and you can install new ones using the dedicated tool in the menu.

## Enhance Extensions

More GNOME extensions have been added to make using the overview and quick settings more pleasant, as well as some updates to existing ones.

## Custom Plymouth and GDM3

Omarell comes with _custom Plymouth_ boot screen and _GDM3_ login screen designs, creating a cohesive and consistent visual experience from boot to login that matches the overall desktop theme.

## Minimal and Essential Software

The system ships with a carefully curated selection of essential tools for GNOME management, deliberately excluding software centers and Snap packages to maintain focus and simplicity. Flatpak comes _pre-configured_ and ready to use from the command line, putting you in _complete control_ of your software installation process.

This minimalist philosophy ensures a lightweight, customizable foundation where you can build your ideal development environment by adding _only what you truly need_, when you need it.
