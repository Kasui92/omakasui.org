# Features

A collection of features that make Omakube lightweight, flexible, and tailored to real everyday use.

## In the heart is Omakub...

It's called Omakube, but that's only a superficial name. Deep down, _it's still the same, beloved Omakub_. The folders, variables, and scripts bear his name, and that's the way it will always be. It's not meant to be anything else...and this is also to ensure it's always compatible with the project it's based on.

## ...but with the passion of Omarchy

The drive and desire to provide something interesting and enjoyable comes from _Omarchy_, which constantly observes and borrows ideas. Whenever a valuable feature appears, if it can be implemented without compromising stability, chances are it will be found here as well.

## Wofi App Launcher & Unified Menu

Omakube features seamless integration with [`Wofi`](https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi), a powerful application launcher for Wayland. This allows for quick access to applications, themes and, most importantly, a **Unified Menu** for all Omakube features.

## Shell Scripts

A set of scripts, adapted from Omarchy and customized for Omakube, designed to simplify the user experience and integrate seamlessly with its features. Just type `omakub-` in the terminal and press `Tab` to see the full list.

## More Default Themes and Extra Themes

There are a few more default themes than Omakub (_catppuccin-latte_ and _osaka-jade_), and you can install new ones using the dedicated tool in the menu.

You can view the extra themes on the [dedicated page](/themes) on OmaKasui.org.

## Enhance Extensions

More GNOME extensions have been added to make using the overview and quick settings more pleasant, as well as some updates to existing ones.

Specifically, [`Tactile`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4548/tactile/)’s grid has been set to 4 columns to provide greater flexibility. In addition, the [`Quick Settings Tweaks`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5446/quick-settings-tweaker/) extension updates the user menu in the GNOME top bar, and [`GNOME 4x UI Improvements`](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4158/gnome-40-ui-improvements/) has been included to bring more consistency to the overview.

## Custom Plymouth and GDM3

Omakube comes with _custom Plymouth_ boot screen and _GDM3_ login screen designs, creating a cohesive and consistent visual experience from boot to login that matches the overall desktop theme.

## No SNAP!

Yes, exactly — _*no Snap*_. It’s a choice I’ve always made and continue to stick with, to avoid a system bloated with preinstalled software and forced defaults. Instead, I prefer to add Snapd only when it’s actually needed, along with any apps that come with it.
