# Omakube

## What is Omakube?

Omakube is a spin-off of [Omakub](https://omakub.org), the one-liner tool that turns a fresh [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/) install into a modern development environment. It takes the same core concepts and goals, but integrates them with the mindset and approach of [Omarchy](https://omarchy.org).

The project doesn’t just provide a ready-made configuration for newcomers to Linux; it also aims to create a comfortable and thoughtful environment, so you don’t need to struggle with setup. _Everything’s already in place—just open the terminal and start exploring_.

## Why Omakube?

Although Omakub has reached a mature and complete stage, I believe there’s still room for growth... and that’s where _Omakube_ comes in. It takes inspiration from the work done with Omarchy, bringing a fresh approach to the same foundation. Its structure, themes, and menus go beyond what comes by default with Omakub or Ubuntu, making it easier to contribute, maintain, and improve the overall ecosystem. It also simplifies the creation of themes and customizations, which were previously more difficult to achieve in Omakub.

I understand the enthusiasm around Arch and Hyprland, and the desire to build a system from the ground up to match that aesthetic and philosophy. However, there are still many who prefer a stable and predictable base — for practical, professional, or personal reasons — and who continue to believe in what Omakub represents. Omakube was created precisely for them: to carry that vision forward and make it even better.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome, both to Omakub itself and to its Manual. Each improvement, correction, or idea helps strengthen the project as a whole. Everything here is designed with sharing in mind: from the structure to the documentation, every part exists to be learned from, built upon, and given back to the community. That’s what keeps Omakube alive and evolving.
