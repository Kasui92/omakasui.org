  <h2>Wayland first</h2>
  <p>
    Omarell is built on and optimized for Wayland, the modern display server
    protocol that offers improved security, performance, and graphics
    capabilities. While compatibility tools are available for legacy X11
    applications, Omarell is <i>primarily oriented</i> towards the Wayland
    ecosystem, ensuring you get the best possible experience with modern Linux
    desktop technologies.

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>GNOME with Forge Extension</h2>
  <p>
    Experience the power of tiling window management with the seamless
    integration of
    <code
      ><a
        href="https://github.com/forge-ext/forge"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >Forge</a
      ></code
    >, a tiling window manager extension for GNOME. Enjoy automatic window
    arrangement, keyboard-driven workflows, and improved productivity without
    sacrificing GNOME's polish and user-friendliness.
    <br />
    And to maintain consistency between windows,
    <code
      ><a
        href="https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners"
        target="_blank"
        rel="noopener"
        >Rounded Window Corners Reload</a
      ></code
    >
    has also been added which applies the same rounded edge to all windows.

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Navigation</h2>
  <p>
    Navigation in Omarell is designed to be <i>keyboard-centric</i>, emphasizing
    shortcuts and efficient workflows. While GNOME's Overview and workspaces are
    maintained and remain functional, they serve to complement the overall
    keyboard-driven experience rather than being the
    <i>primary navigation method</i>. This approach allows for faster, more
    productive interactions with your desktop environment.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Custom Menu and CLI</h2>
  <p>
    You can manage Omarell and its features both through a redesigned menu and a
    custom-built CLI to replicate its functionality and extend it to other
    features.
  </p>

  <div class="video-container">
    <video controls width="100%" height="auto" preload="metadata">
      <source src="../assets/videos/omarell-cli.webm" type="video/webm" />
      <p>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Wofi Integration</h2>
  <p>
    Omarell features seamless integration with
    <code
      ><a href="https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        >Wofi</a
      ></code
    >, a powerful application launcher for Wayland. This allows for quick access
    to applications and themes, providing an organized system while GNOME's
    built-in application launcher remains available.
  </p>

  <div class="video-container">
    <video controls width="100%" height="auto" preload="metadata">
      <source src="../assets/videos/omarell-wofi.webm" type="video/webm" />

  <h2>Minimal and Essential Software</h2>
  <p>
    The system ships with a carefully curated selection of essential tools for
    GNOME management, deliberately excluding software centers and Snap packages
    to maintain focus and simplicity. Flatpak comes <i>pre-configured</i> and
    ready to use from the command line, putting you in
    <i>complete control</i> of your software installation process.
  </p>
  <p>
    This minimalist philosophy ensures a lightweight, customizable foundation
    where you can build your ideal development environment by adding
    <i>only what you truly need</i>, when you need it.
  </p>
