<div class="content-section">
  <h2>In the heart is Omakub...</h2>
  <p>
    It's called Omarell, but that's only a superficial name. Deep down,
    <i>it's still the same, beloved Omakub</i>. The folders, variables, and
    scripts bear his name, and that's the way it will always be. It's not meant
    to be anything else...and this is also to ensure it's always compatible with
    the project it's based on.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>...but with the passion of Omarchy</h2>
  <p>
    The drive and desire to provide something interesting and enjoyable comes
    from <i>Omarchy</i>, which constantly observes and borrows ideas. Whenever a
    valuable feature appears, if it can be implemented without compromising
    stability, chances are it will be found here as well.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Wofi App Launcher & Unified Menu</h2>
  <p>
    Omarell features seamless integration with
    <code
      ><a href="https://hg.sr.ht/~scoopta/wofi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
        >Wofi</a
      ></code
    >, a powerful application launcher for Wayland. This allows for quick access
    to applications, themes and, most importantly, a <b>Unified Menu</b> for all
    Omarell/Omakub features.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>More Themes and Tweaks</h2>
  <p>
    There are a few more default themes than Omakub (<i>catppuccin-latte</i> and
    <i>osaka-jade</i>), and you can install new ones using the dedicated tool in
    the menu.
  </p>
  <p>
    In addition, more GNOME extensions have been added to make using the
    overview and quick settings more pleasant, as well as some updates to
    existing ones.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Custom Plymouth and GDM3</h2>
  <p>
    Omarell comes with custom Plymouth boot screen and GDM3 login screen
    designs, creating a cohesive and consistent visual experience from boot to
    login that matches the overall desktop theme.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="content-section">
  <h2>Minimal and Essential Software</h2>
  <p>
    The system ships with a carefully curated selection of essential tools for
    GNOME management, deliberately excluding software centers and Snap packages
    to maintain focus and simplicity. Flatpak comes <i>pre-configured</i> and
    ready to use from the command line, putting you in
    <i>complete control</i> of your software installation process.
  </p>
  <p>
    This minimalist philosophy ensures a lightweight, customizable foundation
    where you can build your ideal development environment by adding
    <i>only what you truly need</i>, when you need it.
