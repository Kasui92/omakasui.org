  <h2>What is Omarell?</h2>
  <p>
    Omarell is a personalized fork of
    <a href="https://omakub.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omakub</a>, the
    one-liner tool that turns a fresh
    <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a>
    install into a modern development environment. It builds on Omakub with
    targeted tweaks for a more streamlined and opinionated Linux setup.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name comes from
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umarell"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      ><em>umarell</em></a
    >, the Italian archetype of a retiree watching construction sites with a
    critical eye. Likewise, Omarell keeps tabs on the evolving
    <a href="https://omarchy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      >Omarchy project</a
    >, selectively adopting useful changes while staying grounded on a stable,
    proven base.

  <h2>Why Omarell?</h2>
  <p>
    Omakub was created with the aim of offering a pleasant and familiar
    environment, making the transition from other operating systems to the Linux
    world smoother. The idea is to preserve the habits and workflows people are
    used to, relying on GNOME, which lends itself well to this purpose, and on
    the work done by Canonical in ensuring excellent hardware support through
    Ubuntu.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yet, in the Linux community,
    <i>Ubuntu Desktop is often seen as a rather heavy distribution</i>, filled
    with components that may or may not be useful, and
    <i>even its so-called minimal edition is not all that minimal</i>. Its
    native tiling system is far from exciting, and although
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/lundal/tactile" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      ><code>Tactile</code></a
    >
    does a decent job, there is still that lingering sense of something missing
    without proper autotiling.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taking inspiration from the work done on Omarchy, particularly in its
    approach, Omarell moves away from a fresh release of Ubuntu Desktop and
    instead builds on the leaner <b>Ubuntu Server</b> edition.
  </p>
  <p>
    From here, the goal is no longer to simply recreate macOS or Windows
    one-to-one, but rather to capture the essence of window managers by using
    GNOME extensions such as
    <a href="https://github.com/forge-ext/forge" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      ><code>Forge</code></a
    >
    and
    <a
      href="https://github.com/flexagoon/rounded-window-corners"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      ><code>Rounded Window Corners Rebord</code></a
    >, bringing the focus back to keyboard-driven control.
  </p>
  <p>
    Of course, there are compromises along the way, but the intention is not to
    present this as the final solution. <br />
    <i>It is instead a step towards reaching it.</i>
