  <h2>What is Omarell?</h2>
  <p>
    Omarell is a personalized fork of
    <a href="https://omakub.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omakub</a>, the
    one-liner tool that turns a fresh
    <a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a>
    install into a modern development environment. It builds on Omakub with
    targeted tweaks for a more streamlined and opinionated Linux setup.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name comes from
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umarell"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      ><em>umarell</em></a
    >, the Italian archetype of a retiree watching construction sites with a
    critical eye. Likewise, Omarell keeps tabs on the evolving
    <a href="https://omarchy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      >Omarchy project</a
    >, selectively adopting useful changes while staying grounded on a stable,
    proven base.

  <h2>Why Omarell?</h2>

  <p>
    Omarell was born from the need to create an environment tailored to my
    workflow, carrying only the few applications I actually use everywhere. To
    achieve this, I focused on improving element management and building a
    hybrid formula between Omakub with its classic DE setup and the modularity
    of Omarchy. Many of the features were not developed by me but adapted from
    what the Omacom community contributes every day. My role was simply to bring
    them together, prepare them for Ubuntu, and ensure they worked smoothly
    without breaking anything.
