  <h2>What is Omarell?</h2>
  <p>
    Omarell is the progenitor of
    <a href="https://github.com/Kasui92/omakube" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
      >Omakube</a
    >, hence the idea of creating a more "modern" version of
    <a href="https://omakub.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omakub</a>,
    closer to the mentality grown with
    <a href="https://omarchy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Omarchy</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The name comes from
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umarell"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener"
      ><em>umarell</em></a
    >, the Italian archetype of a retiree watching construction sites with a
    critical eye. Just like these elders, Omarell has been following the
    development of Omarchy and has brought over as much as possible to Omakub,
    while still keeping Ubuntu as its solid foundation.

  <h2>Why Omarell?</h2>

  <p>
    Omarell was born from the need to create an environment tailored to my
    workflow, carrying only the few applications I actually use everywhere. No
    unnecessary bloat, just the essentials.
